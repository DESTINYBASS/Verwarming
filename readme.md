This is just a project I am working on for home automation. This is still very much a work in progress. 

In this project I am trying to make a web application to control the heating in my home with my raspberry pi. I will try to documentate as much as possible within the readme.

Today i am trying to generate a random array in python, wich isn't difficult to do, and feed the data to my nodejs app, but when trying to get the data from the python file the array becomes a string. I was able to make it an array again but I'm still struggling with adding the array to the database. What I'm trying to accomplish with trying this is making a little graph with previous temperatures measured and so that once I actually have my sensor it would just pretty much be a plug & play experience.
